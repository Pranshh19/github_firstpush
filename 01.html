<!-- 
    Step 1: Git Init
    Step 2: To see the hidden files we can use ls -Hidden
    Step 3: 
    Git add vs git add* 
    git add filename 
    or 
    git add . (this adds all the file)
    git add . command puts all the files in staging area 

    step 4. Create a gitignore file and add the files you want to not push into git
    step 5: Check the status of files by doing git status

    Step 6: git branch display the branch you're currently at
    Step 7: Too add a new branch just do git branch branchname 
    step 8: To move to this next branch you've to do => git checkout branchname
    Step 9: agr tumhe branch create krke uspr directly move krna hai toh you can do that by 
    git checkout -b branchname

    step 10: If you move to a new branch and update the code/file in that branch then that file scope is in that branch only unless you merge
    Ex: Try this command in your terminal: 
    git checkout pranshu 

    now, see the files, you will find one additional file now. Becuase you're in a new branch, also the git ignore is now gone. 

    step 11: to merge this files just do this and make sure you're in the master branch before doing this
    ex: git merge pranshu 

    Step 12: sometimes conflict aate hai toh unko resolve manually krna pdta hai
